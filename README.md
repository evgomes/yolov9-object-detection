# YOLOv9 - Object Detection

This script uses the YOLOv9 model, published by **Chien-Yao Wang et al. in February 2024**, to detect and predict object categories in videos and images.

YOLOv9 uses deep learning concepts and concepts such as **Programmable Gradient Information (PGI)** and **Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (GELAN)** for object detection, image segmentation, and classification tasks.
